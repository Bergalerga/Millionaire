Due to the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` restrictions in Chrome, you will not be able to load `questions.json`. A simple workaround for this is to run the following in the root folder:

```bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

and thereafter access the website from `localhost:8000`. Keep in mind that the page does not work in Safari or Firefox due to using .waw and .mp4 sound files.
